This application was created for a semester capstone group project aimed at bringing all the learned Database Concepts together. Through this project, I was able to put into
practice the following Database Design Concepts:
1. Database Modeling
- Gained hands-on experience in designing and modeling a relational database to effectively represent the inventory management system for a fictitious coffee supply company

2. Schema Design
- Implemented a well-structured database schema in MariaDB, ensuring efficient organization of tables, relationships, and data integrity constraints.

3. ERD Design
- Created an ERD that visually represents the entities, attributes, and relationships within the database, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the system's architecture.

4. Database Implementation
- Applied the principles of relational management systems (RDBMS) to implement the designed schema in MariaDb, leveraging SQL queries for creating tables, defining relationships, and managing data.

5. Web-Based Front End
- Designed and implemented a user-friendly web-based front-end interface to facilitate indirect interaction with the database, enabling users to intuitively navigate the inventory management system.

6. Back-End Application Logic
- Develop and integrated robust back-end application logic that interacts with the database, providing seamless functionality for managing inventory, product information, and generating tracking reports.

7. Integration of various technologies
- Explored the integration of various technologies, including the LAMP stack, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and AJAX, to create a comprehensive solution that leverages both front-end and back-end technologies.
